# Number-Guessing-Game
just trying some JS DOM Manipulation exercises for fun.

The game lets a user guess the hidden number between 1-20 by choosing one at a time. If the user guesses the number, they win. If the user fails, the total score gets deducted. This is created using basic DOM manipulation.
